Website Description:

The website loads a basemap of Calgary. 
Located above the map there is a date selector for the user to search for build permits 
within a certain time period. Once the dates are selected and applied, the map updates
with icons showing the location of each building permit that the search returned. 
The user can click on any marker icon, a popup will show some details about that permit.
For the best display, the markers are clustered into groups, depending on the zoom level.

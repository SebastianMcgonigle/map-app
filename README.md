Website Description:

PART 1: Building Permits
The website loads a basemap of Calgary. Located above the map there is a date selector for the user to search for build permits within a certain time period. Once the dates are selected and applied, the map updates with icons showing the location of each building permit that the search returned. The user can click on any marker icon, a popup will show some details about that permit. For the best display, the markers are clustered into groups, depending on the zoom level.

PART 2: Traffic Incidents + Map Layer Design
Switch to the second map layer named Traffic Incidents using the top right corner button.
A heatmap shows the locations of traffic incidents in Calgary.
The basemap is has dark ground features and white streets to emphasise the traffic routes.
Natural features in green and water in blue to contrast the dark and white colours.
Each data point has a radius of 30 pixels and an opacity value which changes with the zoom level.
